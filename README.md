# Text-Based-Game
My first ever programming project: A 3 - 4 hour text-based video game called 'The Fate of Eldoria', complete with a storyline, almost 45 different locations, background setting for each area, clues and puzzles etc, to help give a fun and immersive experience despite being entirely text-based!
